# Horiseon Accessible Webpage

## Description

This is an example webpage for the fictional company Horiseon. The initial, broken code was refactored to fit better standards of coding practice and web accessibility.

This rendition of the Horiseon site was reached in part by changing unnecessary divs into more fitting semantic elements, adding alt text to images (fitting accessibility best practices), and consolidating redundant code in the css.
